=>live-server is better
In this repository, you might want to install
`http-server` package, which is simple but powerful local server.

```
npm install --global http-server
```

2. Globally via Homebrew

```
brew install http-server
```

## How to play?

Move to any root directory or folder however else you like. And then run the local server with the package we've just installed above.

```
http-server
```
